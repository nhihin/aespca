## Comparison of brain transcriptomes from 5XFAD mice, fAD-like zebrafish, and human early-onset as well as late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease

- Workflow in R using AESPCA to explore and compare brain transcriptomes across various species in Alzheimer's disease contexts. 

- For more details, please see **Chapter 5: Adaptive elastic-net sparse PCA for robust cross-species, cross-platform analysis of complex gene expression data in Alzheimerâ€™s disease** in my thesis (https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/129610, p.165 onwards).
